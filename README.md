This Python-based To-Do List application combines the simplicity of a traditional task manager with the power of AI to help you break down complex tasks into actionable subtasks. Built using **Tkinter** for the GUI and **GPT4All** for AI-driven task breakdowns, this app is perfect for anyone looking to stay organized while leveraging AI assistance.

## **Features**  
- **AI-Generated Subtasks**: Automatically breaks down main tasks into 3 clear, actionable subtasks using GPT4All.  
- **Persistent Storage**: Saves your tasks locally, so you never lose track of your progress.  
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean and user-friendly design with checkboxes for task completion.  
- **Customizable**: Easily replace the GPT4All model with your preferred version.

## **How It Works**  
1. Enter a main task (e.g., "Plan a vacation").  
2. The app uses GPT4All to generate 3 subtasks (e.g., "Book flights", "Choose hotel", "Create itinerary").  
3. Check off tasks as you complete them, and delete finished tasks with one click.
